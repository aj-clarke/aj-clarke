## Hi there 👋, I'm AJ

I'm a Software Engineer based in Chesterfield, Virginia, with several years of experience in the Ruby and JavaScript ecosystems. Most recently I co-created **[Orion](https://orion-edge.dev)** which is an open-source GraphQL edge caching solution with automated infrastructure provisioning, cache telemetry, and intelligent cache invalidation across globally distributed CDN infrastructure.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying time with my wife and kids, getting in a workout with friends, or trying to figure out what to 3d print next.

## ⚡ Orion

[Orion](https://orion-edge.dev) is an open-source edge caching solution that bridges GraphQL's flexible querying with CDN performance benefits traditionally limited to REST APIs. [Orion](https://orion-edge.dev) implements POST-to-GET transformation at CDN edges, enabling sub-second cache purging and real-time performance monitoring across globally distributed infrastructure.

**Technologies Used:**
JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Fastly CDN, Fastly Compute@Edge, VCL, WebAssembly, AWS (Kinesis), Terraform
